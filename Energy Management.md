# Energy Management

## 1. Manage Energy, Not Time

**Emotional Quadrants:**
- Excitement
- Stress
- Depression
- Calm

The key idea is to spend time in the Excitement, Stress, and Calm quadrants for a balanced, engaging, and fulfilling life. Stress, while inevitable, helps with growth, but prolonged stress can lead to burnout or anxiety. Adopting a mindset that embraces stress to complete tasks can reduce future stress and enhance skills. After stressful periods, switch to activities in the Calm quadrant to relax and recover.

### Questions:

**Question 1:**  
What activities do you do that make you relax and move into the Calm quadrant?

**Question 2:**  
When do you find yourself getting into the Stress quadrant?

**Question 3:**  
How do you recognize when you are in the Excitement quadrant?
