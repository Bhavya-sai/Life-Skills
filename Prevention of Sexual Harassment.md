# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## Introduction
Sexual harassment is a major concern with regard to people current in different settings, such as the working places, institutions of learning, and public domains. It is important to make sure that sexual harassment does not happen in order to protect all individuals at the workplace.

## Understanding Sexual Harassment
Sexual harassment can take many forms, including:

- **Verbal Harassment**: Inappropriate comments, jokes, or propositions.
- **Physical Harassment**: Unwanted touching or physical advances.
- **Visual Harassment**: Sharing or displaying inappropriate images or materials.
- **Cyber Harassment**: Harassment through digital platforms, such as social media or email.

### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would take the following steps:

- **Document the incident**: Write down the details of the harassment, including dates, times, locations, and descriptions of what occurred. This documentation can be crucial for any future reports.
- **Speak up**: If I feel safe to do so, I would confront the harasser directly, stating that their behaviour is inappropriate and unwelcome. It’s important to express discomfort clearly.
- **Report the behaviour**: I would report the incident to a supervisor, HR representative, or any designated authority within the organization. It’s important to ensure that the report is made through the proper channels.
- **Support the victim**: If I witness someone else being harassed, I would offer my support, help them document the incident, and encourage them to report it.
- **Seek resources**: I would also look for support services, such as counseling or legal assistance, if needed, to ensure that the issue is handled appropriately and that all parties involved receive the necessary support.
